This project contains a series of hands-on coding tasks that cover essential Go concurrency concepts. Each quiz focuses on a specific concurrency pattern or technique, providing you with practical experience in writing concurrent Go code.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **Goroutines**: Lightweight threads and concurrent execution
- **Channels**: Communication and synchronization between goroutines
- **Context**: Cancellation, timeouts, and request-scoped values
- **Worker Pools**: Managing concurrent workloads efficiently
- **Pipeline Patterns**: Building data processing pipelines
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors in concurrent operations
- **Stream Processing**: Working with streams of data
- **Advanced Patterns**: Fan-out/fan-in, tee, bridge, and more

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Basic understanding of Go syntax and concepts

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd go-concurrency-quizzes
   ```

2. Navigate to any quiz directory:

   ```bash
   cd "Channel Relay with Context Cancellation"
   ```

3. Read the README.md file to understand the task requirements

4. Implement the required functions in `main.go`

5. Run your solution:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## üéØ How to Use

1. **Choose a Quiz**: Start with basic concepts and work your way up to advanced patterns
2. **Read the Requirements**: Each quiz has a detailed README explaining what to implement
3. **Implement the Solution**: Write your code in the provided `main.go` file
4. **Test Your Code**: Run the program to verify your implementation works correctly
5. **Study the Patterns**: Understand how the concurrency patterns work and when to use them

## üìñ Learning Path
